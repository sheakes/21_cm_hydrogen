# 21_cm_hydrogen
Having just finished my first computing course in Fall 2021 CPSC:103 Systematic Program Design I intended to put my new skill to astronomical data.
Using data collected from the open source radio telescope PICTOR(https://pictortelescope.com/) based in Athens, Greece I computed the dopler shift for hydrogen clouds.

I recieved the following email.
